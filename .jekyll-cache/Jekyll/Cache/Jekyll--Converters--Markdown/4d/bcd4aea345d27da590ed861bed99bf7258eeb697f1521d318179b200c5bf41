<p>By the name “collab” it means we are combining. In this case we combine multiple user
information and filter out the items that from the group of user that has similar tastes to the
user. In general it’s a technique for filtering an item, which a user might like on the basis of
combined actions by group of similar user</p>

<h2 id="euclidean-distance-score">Euclidean Distance Score</h2>

<p>Let’s say a person who has identical taste with other people is 1 and 0 for those who has no
similar taste with other people, so our similarity value ranges from 0 to 1. Since we are
combining people to find similarity among them and recommend a product depending on
how similar they are. In order to measure similarity, I will be using Euclidean Distance Score
in this article. There are many other measures depending on the problem you can chose
other distance score measures. For this article I will be using movie lens dataset where you
can find movie,user,rating.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Load the dataset</li>
  <li>Step 2: Calculate the similarity score between each user. If ‘user1’ is the one we are trying to
recommend to then calcuate the similairy between ‘user1’ and all other users.</li>
</ul>
<center>d=√((x2-x1)²+(y2-y1)²)</center>
<center>similarity score (r) = 1/(1+d)</center>

<ul>
  <li>Step 3: for every other user multiple each similarity we calculate in step 2 with the product
rating that user has not rated before. In this case we will be multiplying other product which
‘user1’ has never rated before. It looks something like this in the figure below</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the following things you must do before getting started with implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have python installed in your system</li>
  <li>You must have basic knowledge of python programming</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Collabarative filtering is useful when your dataset is small and keeps on changing. But it
does have some disadvantages like its computation time is significantly slower when your
dataset increases. So depending on the problem we can use this technique to recommend
product to users</p>

<p>By the name ‚Äúcollab‚Äù it means we are combining. In this case we combine multiple user
information and filter out the items that from the group of user that has similar tastes to the
user. In general it‚Äôs a technique for filtering an item, which a user might like on the basis of

<p>These are the following things you must do before getting started with implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have python installed in your system</li>
  <li>You must have basic knowledge of python programming</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Collabarative filtering is useful when your dataset is small and keeps on changing. But it
does have some disadvantages like its computation time is significantly slower when your
dataset increases. So depending on the problem we can use this technique to recommend
product to users</p>
